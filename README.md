#NTRIGHTS.exe#

[ntrights.exe](http://ss64.com/nt/ntrights.html) was a utility that came with the Resource kits for Windows 2000 and Windows 2003.

At some point I might make a full blown clone of ntrights.exe. At the moment this adds the `SeServiceLogonRight` (Log on as a service) privilege to a local user called zippy. I used this to test functionality I want to add to [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) in [Server-1227](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-1227).
